        <h2>Basic Elementrary</h2>
        <p class="description">
            In this game coded in Scratch, follow a purple square on a journey through school as it learns all of the basics. 
            Help it find lost objects and complete school. Use the arrow keys to manuver through the school. 
            Try exiting school or visiting the teachers at different scores, they may have something else to say!

            I made this game as the final project for my AP Computer Science Principles class summer homework in the year 2019. 
            The assignment was to customize one of the seven games made as apart of the Google CS-First course by adding custom graphics and features. 
            I based the game off of the 'find object' game from the Google CS-First course and I wrote it in the coding laguage "Scratch". 
            I added new graphics, depth, and a moving animation for my square avatar. 
            I learned how to animate a figure by quickly moving through several pictures, which was really fun. 
            I also solidified my knowledge on some basic concepts of computing, such as logic.
            I had difficulty making the square look like it was moving from room to room. 
            I didn't want to make too many sprites, so I changed the background and the door sprite's costume whenever the purple square touched the right edge of the screen.
            By changing the costumes and backgrounds in a specific order, I created the illusion of movement.

        <h2>Mandala</h2>
        <p class="description">
            Did you know you can use code to make beautiful drawings? 
            In this Snap! project, I used a for loop to draw an image known as an mandala. 
            This is an image of the finished coded mandala.

            I made this for an assignment for my APCSP class. The program was made with the guidance of Beauty and Joy of Computing lessons
