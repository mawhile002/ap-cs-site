        <h2>Basic Elementrary</h2>
        <p class="description">In this game coded in Scratch, follow a purple square on a journey through school as it learns all of the basics. Help it find lost objects and complete school. Use the arrow keys to manuver through the school. Try exiting school or visiting the teachers at different scores, they may have something else to say!<!--Add text here to explain game-->
        <br class="newparagraph"> I made this game as the final project for my AP Computer Science Principles class in the year 2019. I based the game off of the 'find object' game that the program Google CS teaches its students to make. I added new graphics, depth, and a moving animation for my square.

        <h2>Mandala</h2>
        <p class="description">Did you know you can use code to make beautiful drawings? In this Snap! project, I used a for loop to draw an image known as an mandala. This is an image of the finished coded mandala.
        <br class="newparagraph">I made this for an assignment for my APCSP class. The program was made with the guidance of Beauty and Joy of Computing lessons
