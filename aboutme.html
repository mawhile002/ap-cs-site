    <p class="description">My name is Alia. I am a student in California. I have been on the Cross-Country team at my school for 7 years, although in my seventh year I have been spliting my time between the team and the school play. In my limited free time, I like to draw, paint, free write, walk my dog, watch TV, sleep, or hang out with my friends amoung many other things. This site is a place to house my online endeavors and to let other's see what I have or am currently working on.</p>
